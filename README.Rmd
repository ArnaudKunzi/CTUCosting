# CTUcosting

Internal package for costings


```{r}
library(ctucosting)
devtools::load_all()
```

Example code:
```{r}
token <- readLines("O:/tokens/costing.txt")

prepped <- all_dataprep(record = 1, 
                        costing = 1)

gen_pdf("test.pdf", prepped)
```

This will not be the final piece though... `all_dataprep` is a convenience function... in practice it will need to be separated out.
